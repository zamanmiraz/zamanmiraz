## 👋 Hi there, I'm Miraz!

🎯 I’m a Research Scientist specializing in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and AI**, with a PhD in Computational Analysis & Modeling and a strong foundation in Computer Science and Mathematics.

### 🔬 What I Work On
- 🔭 Developing end-to-end ML pipelines for **anomaly detection, computer vision**, and **cyber-physical systems**
- 🤖 Building and evaluating **deep learning models** (e.g., YOLO for object detection and segmentation)
- ⚡ Designing **Reinforcement Learning environments** for smart grid control and optimization using OpenDSS & Gymnasium

### 🚀 Projects I work
- 🔍 **Computer Vision Models**: Object detection and segmentation with YOLOv5/SAM on video data (fire ignition)
- 🌐 **Reinforcement Learning for Grid Resilience**: Simulations and policy optimization for DOE-sponsored power systems
- 🔐 **Cyber-Physical Intrusion Detection**: Lightweight real-time IDS with hybrid data streams and auto-healing control
- 🧠 **AI for Smart Energy**: ML models for DER system anomaly detection and control strategy adaptation

### 💡 Tools & Tech I Use 📊
- Python, PyTorch, NumPy, Pandas, SciPy, SQL, Gymnasium, Ray, YOLO, Matplotlib  
- OpenDSS, Docker, Intel SGX, Blockchain, Elasticsearch, SageMath  
- Microsoft Azure (Certified: Data Fundamentals)
